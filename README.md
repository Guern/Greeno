## Technology

This project is based on [ADF (angular-dashboard-framework) Project](http://github.com/sdorra/angular-dashboard-framework) a responsive, advanced framework based on the cutting-edge technologies.

# angular-dashboard-framework

> Dashboard framework with Angular.js, Twitter Bootstrap and Font Awesome.

The api of angular-dashboard-framework (adf) is documented [here](http://sdorra.github.io/angular-dashboard-framework/docs/).


## Demo

A live demo of the adf can be viewed [here](http://guern.github.io/greeno/). The demo uses html5 localStorage to store the state of the dashboard. The source of the demo can be found [here](https://github.com/guern/greeno).

## Getting started

Install bower and grunt:

```bash
npm install -g bower
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/guern/greeno
cd greeno
```

Install npm and bower dependencies:

```bash
npm install
bower install
```

You can start the sample dashboard, by using the server grunt task:

```bash
grunt server
```

Now you open the sample in your browser at http://localhost:9001/sample

Or you can create a release build of angular-dashboard-framework and the samples:

```bash
grunt
grunt sample
```
The sample and the final build of angular-dashboard-framework are now in the dist directory.
